User test task

can you get the demo and tell me what do you feel about it, can you tell me what do you expect valence to do
(so we can know if valence give people the right imporession of what it can do)

so the goal is to repicate the demo with valence, it will not be create everything step by step, but we will work through the highlights
can you set up a valence account
ok, how do you feel about the set up

have a look at this dashboard, can you tell me what each icon repersents?
(so we know if using the icon only sidebar is  good idea)

are you clear that you know what each access level means for each user?

create a database now and name it todo list app

anyone can create 

allow todo list creator to complete their todos

allow admin to to modify the the content and completion and delet a todo

allow all asb verifiy customer to modfiy the content and completeiion of any todo task

i add accouting manager mike to be the admin, what would you do
