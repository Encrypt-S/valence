Why need 

New field and [+] icon confused, thought [+] is new field
Doesn’t expect [+] means link
Need to provide both [new table] and [+] because some people think about data structure then relationships, some people are the other way around
Like to see the code the database is generated
create many fields at once
required field is confusing
Icons [三] is not clear that is means view all records
How to test the query if it’s a database, should we build this as part of valence
Task 2 is painless
Why use relationship database, rob is hard on
explain why I need seed phrase
Data type from user input, why from user input
Generate table automatically
Why need account and password, for multiple user share the same computer
SQL server visual

Solution
create overlay guides on creating tables or creating field will be good
